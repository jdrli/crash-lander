# Crash Lander - QA Testing Dashboard

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) frontend for the Crash Lander API, designed as a client-facing dashboard for comprehensive website quality analysis. This is a work-in-progress! Just began work on this front-end, so I'm working on catching it up to reflect all the API functionality.

## About This Project

Crash Lander is a sophisticated QA testing dashboard that provides detailed insights into website quality through automated testing. The application features:

- **Comprehensive Testing Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of website quality metrics
- **Space-Themed UI**: Modern, engaging interface with animated elements and dark theme
- **Multi-Domain Analysis**: Evaluate websites across multiple quality dimensions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track key performance indicators over time
- **Detailed Reporting**: In-depth analysis of website health and optimization opportunities

### Core Features

1. **Diagnostic Benchmarks**: Performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices analysis
2. **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive site evaluation with pass/fail indicators
4. **Real-time Results**: Instant feedback on website quality metrics
5. **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes

## Important Note - Client-Facing Only

⚠️ **This repository contains only the frontend/client codebase.** ⚠️

The Crash Lander application requires a backend API to function, which is not included in this repository. As such:

- Users **cannot** run this application locally without the accompanying API
- The frontend is provided for demonstration and educational purposes only
- Full functionality requires access to the proprietary backend services
- If you want to run the full project locally, message me!
