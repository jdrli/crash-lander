## Important Note - Client-Facing Only

⚠️ **This repository contains only the frontend/client codebase.** ⚠️

The Crash Lander application requires a backend API to function, which is not included in this repository. As such:

- Users **cannot** run this application locally without the accompanying API
- The frontend is provided for demonstration and educational purposes only
- Full functionality requires access to the proprietary backend services
